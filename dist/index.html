                Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering
                plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw
                product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a
                consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in
                hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.

                Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due
                to its caffeine content.<sup>[3]</sup> It is one of the most popular drinks in the world<sup>[4]</sup>
                and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte, or
                already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common.
                Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.
                It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert, like doughnuts. A commercial establishment
                that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffeehouse or coffee shop (not to be confused with
                Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis).

                Clinical research indicates that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial as a
                stimulant in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption reduces the risk
                of some diseases, although some of the long-term studies are of questionable credibility.<sup>[5]</sup>

                The earliest credible evidence of the drinking of coffee in the form of the modern beverage appears in
                modern-day Yemen from the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first
                roasted and brewed in a manner similar to current methods.<sup>[2]</sup> The Yemenis procured the coffee
                beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries and began cultivation. By the 16th
                century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe.

                The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and C. robusta. Coffee plants are
                cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia,
                the Indian subcontinent, and Africa. As of 2018, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans,
                producing 35% of the world total.<sup>[6]</sup> Coffee is a major export commodity as the leading legal
                agricultural export for numerous countries.<sup>[7]</sup> It is one of the most valuable commodities
                exported by developing countries. Green, unroasted coffee is the most traded agricultural commodity and
                one of the most traded commodities overall, second only to petroleum.<sup>[8]</sup> Despite the sales of
                coffee reaching billions of dollars, those actually producing the beans are disproportionately living in
                poverty.<sup>[9]</sup> Critics also point to the coffee industry's negative impact on the environment
                and the clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use. The environmental costs and wage disparity of
                farmers are causing the market for fair trade and organic coffee to expand.<sup>[10]</sup>
