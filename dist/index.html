                <id="1"<strong></strong> This article is about the Mongol khanate established in the 13th century. For
                    other uses, see Golden Horde (disambiguation).
                    The Golden Horde, self-designated as Ulug Ulus, lit. 'Great State' in Turkic,<sup>[8]</sup> was
                    originally a
                    Mongol and later Turkicized khanate established in the 13th century and originating as the
                    northwestern sector of the Mongol Empire.<sup>[9] </sup>With the fragmentation of the Mongol Empire
                    after 1259
                    it became a functionally separate khanate. It is also known as the Kipchak Khanate or as the Ulus of
                    Jochi.<sup>[10]</sup>After the death of Batu Khan (the founder of the Golden Horde) in 1255, his
                    dynasty
                    flourished for a full century, until 1359, though the intrigues of Nogai instigated a partial civil
                    war in the late 1290s. The Horde's military power peaked during the reign of Uzbeg Khan (1312–1341),
                    who adopted Islam. The territory of the Golden Horde at its peak extended from Siberia and Central
                    Asia to parts of Eastern Europe from the Urals to the Danube in the west, and from the Black Sea to
                    the Caspian Sea in the south, while bordering the Caucasus Mountains and the territories of the
                    Mongol dynasty known as the Ilkhanate.<sup>[10]</sup>The khanate experienced violent internal
                    political
                    disorder beginning in 1359, before it briefly reunited (1381–1395) under Tokhtamysh. However, soon
                    after the 1396 invasion of Timur, the founder of the Timurid Empire, the Golden Horde broke into
                    smaller Tatar khanates which declined steadily in power. At the start of the 15th century, the Horde
                    began to fall apart. By 1466, it was being referred to simply as the "Great Horde". Within its
                    territories there emerged numerous predominantly Turkic-speaking khanates. These internal struggles
                    allowed the northern vassal state of Muscovy to rid itself of the "Tatar Yoke" at the Great Stand on
                    the Ugra River in 1480. The Crimean Khanate and the Kazakh Khanate, the last remnants of the Golden
                    Horde, survived until 1783 and 1847 respectively.

            <h1> Name </h1>
            <p id="2">
                The name Golden Horde, a partial calque of Russian Золотая Орда (Zolotája Ordá), itself supposedly a
                partial calque of Turkic Altan Orda, is said to have been inspired by the golden color of the tents the
                Mongols lived in during wartime, or an actual golden tent used by Batu Khan or by Uzbek Khan,[11] or to
                have been bestowed by the Slavic tributaries to describe the great wealth of the khan. The Turkic word
                orda means "palace", "camp" or "headquarters", in this case the headquarters of the khan, being the
                capital of the khanate, metonymically extended to the khanate itself. It was not until the 16th century
                that Russian chroniclers begin explicitly using the term "Golden Horde" to refer to this particular
                successor khanate of the Mongol Empire. The first known use of the term, in 1565, in the Russian
                chronicle History of Kazan, applied it to the Ulus of Batu (Russian: Улуса Батыя), centered on
                Sarai.[12][13] In contemporary Persian, Armenian and Muslim writings, and in the records of the
                thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries such as the Yuanshi and the Jami' al-tawarikh, the khanate was
                called the "Ulus of Jochi" ("realm of Jochi" in Mongolian), "Dasht-i-Qifchaq" (Qipchaq Steppe) or
                "Khanate of the Qipchaq" and "Comania" (Cumania).[14][15]

                The eastern or left wing (or "left hand" in official Mongolian-sponsored Persian sources) was referred
                to as the Blue Horde in Russian chronicles and as the White Horde in Timurid sources (e.g. Zafar-Nameh).
                Western scholars have tended to follow the Timurid sources' nomenclature and call the left wing the
                White Horde. But Ötemish Hajji (fl. 1550), a historian of Khwarezm, called the left wing the Blue Horde,
                and since he was familiar with the oral traditions of the khanate empire, it seems likely that the
                Russian chroniclers were correct, and that the khanate itself called its left wing the Blue Horde.[16]
                The khanate apparently used the term White Horde to refer to its right wing, which was situated in
                Batu's home base in Sarai and controlled the ulus. However, the designations Golden Horde, Blue Horde,
                and White Horde have not been encountered in the sources of the Mongol period.[17]

            <h1> Mongol origins (1225–1241) </h1>
            <p id="3">
                At his death in 1227, Genghis Khan divided the Mongol Empire amongst his four sons as appanages, but the
                Empire remained united under the supreme khan. Jochi was the eldest, but he died six months before
                Genghis. The westernmost lands occupied by the Mongols, which included what is today southern Russia and
                Kazakhstan, were given to Jochi's eldest sons, Batu Khan, who eventually became ruler of the Blue Horde,
                and Orda Khan, who became the leader of the White Horde.[18][19] In 1235, Batu with the great general
                Subutai began an invasion westwards, first conquering the Bashkirs and then moving on to Volga Bulgaria
                in 1236. From there he conquered some of the southern steppes of present-day Ukraine in 1237, forcing
                many of the local Cumans to retreat westward. The Mongol campaign against the Kypchaks and Cumans had
                already started under Jochi and Subutai in 1216–1218 when the Merkits took shelter among them. By 1239 a
                large portion of Cumans were driven out of the Crimean peninsula, and it became one of the appanages of
                the Mongol Empire.[20] The remnants of the Crimean Cumans survived in the Crimean mountains, and they
                would, in time, mix with other groups in the Crimea (including Greeks, Goths, and Mongols) to form the
                Crimean Tatar population. Moving north, Batu began the Mongol invasion of Rus' and spent three years
                subjugating the principalities of former Kievan Rus', whilst his cousins Möngke, Kadan, and Güyük moved
                southwards into Alania.


                Decisive Golden Horde victory in the Battle of Mohi
                Using the migration of the Cumans as their casus belli, the Mongols continued west, raiding Poland and
                Hungary, which culminated in Mongol victories at the battles of Legnica and Mohi. In 1241, however,
                Ögedei Khan died in the Mongolian homeland. Batu turned back from his siege of Vienna but did not return
                to Mongolia, rather opting to stay at the Volga River. His brother Orda returned to take part in the
                succession. The Mongol armies would never again travel so far west. In 1242, after retreating through
                Hungary, destroying Pest in the process, and subjugating Bulgaria,[21] Batu established his capital at
                Sarai, commanding the lower stretch of the Volga River, on the site of the Khazar capital of Atil.
                Shortly before that, the younger brother of Batu and Orda, Shiban, was given his own enormous ulus east
                of the Ural Mountains along the Ob and Irtysh Rivers.

                While the Mongolian language was undoubtedly in general use at the court of Batu, few Mongol texts
                written in the territory of the Golden Horde have survived, perhaps because of the prevalent general
                illiteracy. According to Grigor'ev, yarliq, or decrees of the Khans, were written in Mongol, then
                translated into the Cuman language. The existence of Arabic-Mongol and Persian-Mongol dictionaries
                dating from the middle of the 14th century and prepared for the use of the Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate
                suggests that there was a practical need for such works in the chancelleries handling correspondence
                with the Golden Horde. It is thus reasonable to conclude that letters received by the Mamluks – if not
                also written by them – must have been in Mongol.[21]

        <h1> Batu Khan (1242–1256) </h1>
        <p id="4">

            When the Great Khatun Töregene invited Batu to elect the next Emperor of the Mongol Empire in 1242, he
            declined to attend the kurultai and instead stayed at the Volga River. Although Batu excused himself by
            saying he was suffering from old age and illness, it seems that he did not support the election of Güyük
            Khan. Güyük and Büri, a grandson of Chagatai Khan, had quarreled violently with Batu at a victory banquet
            during the Mongol occupation of Eastern Europe. He sent his brothers to the kurultai, and the new Khagan of
            the Mongols was elected in 1246.

            All the senior Rus' princes, including Yaroslav II of Vladimir, Daniel of Galicia, and Sviatoslav III of
            Vladimir, acknowledged Batu's supremacy. Originally Batu ordered Daniel to turn the administration of
            Galicia over to the Mongols, but Daniel personally visited Batu in 1245 and pledged allegiance to him. After
            returning from his trip, Daniel was visibly influenced by the Mongols, and equipped his army in the Mongol
            fashion. Austrian visitors to his camp remarked that all of Daniel's horsemen dressed like Mongols. The only
            one who did not was Daniel himself, who dressed according to "the Russian custom".[22] Michael of Chernigov,
            who had killed a Mongol envoy in 1240, refused to show obeisance and was executed in 1246.[23]

            When Güyük called Batu to pay him homage several times, Batu sent Yaroslav II, Andrey II of Vladimir and
            Alexander Nevsky to Karakorum in Mongolia in 1247. Yaroslav II never returned and died in Mongolia. He was
            probably poisoned by Töregene Khatun, who probably did it to spite Batu and even her own son Güyük, because
            he did not approve of her regency.[24] Güyük appointed Andrey Grand prince of Vladimir-Suzdal and Alexander
            prince of Kiev. However when they returned, Andrey went to Vladimir while Alexander went to Novgorod
            instead. A bishop by the name of Cyril went to Kiev and found it so devastated that he abandoned the place
            and went further east instead.[25][26]

            In 1248, Güyük demanded Batu come eastward to meet him, a move that some contemporaries regarded as a
            pretext for Batu's arrest. In compliance with the order, Batu approached, bringing a large army. When Güyük
            moved westwards, Tolui's widow and a sister of Batu's stepmother Sorghaghtani warned Batu that the Jochids
            might be his target. Güyük died on the way, in what is now Xinjiang, at about the age of 42. Although some
            modern historians believe that he died of natural causes because of deteriorating health,[27] he may have
            succumbed to the combined effects of alcoholism and gout, or he may have been poisoned. William of Rubruck
            and a Muslim chronicler state that Batu killed the imperial envoy, and one of his brothers murdered the
            Great Khan Güyük, but these claims are not completely corroborated by other major sources. Güyük's widow
            Oghul Qaimish took over as regent, but she would be unable to keep the succession within her branch of the
            family.


            Routes taken by Mongol invaders
            With the assistance of Batu, Möngke succeeded as Great Khan in 1251. Utilizing the discovery of a plot
            designed to remove him, Möngke as the new Great Khan began a purge of his opponents. Estimates of the deaths
            of aristocrats, officials, and Mongol commanders range from 77 to 300. Batu became the most influential
            person in the Mongol Empire as his friendship with Möngke ensured the unity of the realm. Batu, Möngke, and
            other princely lines shared rule over the area from Afghanistan to Turkey. Batu allowed Möngke's
            census-takers to operate freely in his realm. In 1252–1259, Möngke conducted a census of the Mongol Empire,
            including Iran, Afghanistan, Georgia, Armenia, Rus', Central Asia, and North China. While the census in
            China was completed in 1252, Novgorod in the far northwest was not counted until winter 1258–59.[28]

            With the new powers afforded to Batu by Möngke, he now had direct control over the Rus' princes. However the
            Grand Prince Andrey II refused to submit to Batu. Batu sent a punitive expedition under Nevruy, who defeated
            Andrey and forced him to flee to Novgorod, then Pskov, and finally to Sweden. The Mongols overran Vladimir
            and harshly punished the principality. The Livonian Knights stopped their advance to Novgorod and Pskov.
            Thanks to his friendship with Sartaq Khan, Batu's son, who was a Christian, Alexander was installed as the
            Grand Prince of Vladimir (i.e., the supreme Russian ruler) by Batu in 1252.[29]

            Berke (1258–1266)
            After Batu died in 1256, his son Sartaq Khan was appointed by Möngke Khan. As soon as he returned from the
            court of the Great Khan in Mongolia, Sartaq died. The infant Ulaghchi succeeded him under the regency of
            Boragchin Khatun. The khatun summoned all the Rus' princes to Sarai to renew their patents. In 1256 Andrey
            traveled to Sarai to ask for pardon. He was once again reappointed as prince of Vladimir-Suzdal.[30]

            Ulaghchi died soon after and Batu Khan's younger brother Berke, who had been converted to Islam, was
            enthroned as khan of the Golden Horde in 1258.[31]

            In 1256, Daniel of Galicia openly defied the Mongols and ousted their troops in northern Podolia. In 1257,
            he repelled Mongol assaults led by the prince Kuremsa on Ponyzia and Volhynia and dispatched an expedition
            with the aim of taking Kiev. Despite initial successes, in 1259 a Mongol force under Boroldai entered
            Galicia and Volhynia and offered an ultimatum: Daniel was to destroy his fortifications or Boroldai would
            assault the towns. Daniel complied and pulled down the city walls. In 1259 Berke launched savage attacks on
            Lithuania and Poland, and demanded the submission of Béla IV, the Hungarian monarch, and the French King
            Louis IX in 1259 and 1260.[32] His assault on Prussia in 1259/60 inflicted heavy losses on the Teutonic
            Order.[33] The Lithuanians were probably tributary in the 1260s, when reports reached the Curia that they
            were in league with the Mongols.[34]

            Mongol agents began taken censuses in the Rus' principalities. Novgorod in the far northwest was not counted
            until winter 1258–59. There was an uprising in Novgorod against the Mongol census, but Alexander Nevsky
            forced the city to submit to the census and taxation.[28]

            In 1261, Berke approved the establishment of a church in Sarai.[35]

        <div class="Toluid Civil War (1260–1264)">

            <h1> Toluid Civil War (1260–1264) </h1>
            <p id="5"> After Möngke Khan died in 1259, the Toluid Civil War broke out between Kublai Khan and Ariq Böke.
                While Hulagu Khan of the Ilkhanate supported Kublai, Berke sided with Ariq Böke.[36] There is evidence
                that Berke minted coins in Ariq Böke's name,[37] but he remained militarily neutral. After the defeat of
                Ariq Böke in 1264, he freely acceded to Kublai's enthronement.[38] However, some elites of the White
                Horde joined Ariq Böke's resistance.

            <div class="Berke–Hulagu war (1262–1266)">

                <h1> Berke–Hulagu war (1262–1266)</h1>
                <p id="5"> Möngke ordered the Jochid and Chagatayid families to join Hulagu's expedition to Iran.
                    Berke's persuasion might have forced his brother Batu to postpone Hulagu's operation, little
                    suspecting that it would result in eliminating the Jochid predominance there for several years.
                    During the reign of Batu or his first two successors, the Golden Horde dispatched a large Jochid
                    delegation to participate in Hulagu's expedition in the Middle East in 1256/57.

                    One of the Jochid princes who joined Hulagu's army was accused of witchcraft and sorcery against
                    Hulagu. After receiving permission from Berke, Hulagu executed him. After that two more Jochid
                    princes died suspiciously. According to some Muslim sources, Hulagu refused to share his war booty
                    with Berke in accordance with Genghis Khan's wish. Berke was a devoted Muslim who had had a close
                    relationship with the Abbasid Caliph Al-Musta'sim, who had been killed by Hulagu in 1258. The
                    Jochids believed that Hulagu's state eliminated their presence in the Transcaucasus.[39] Those
                    events increased the anger of Berke and the war between the Golden Horde and the Ilkhanate soon
                    broke out in 1262.

                    The increasing tension between Berke and Hulagu was a warning to the Golden Horde contingents in
                    Hulagu's army to flee. One contingent reached the Kipchak Steppe, another traversed Khorasan, and a
                    third body took refuge in Mamluk ruled Syria where they were well received by Sultan Baybars
                    (1260–1277). Hulagu harshly punished the rest of the Golden Horde army in Iran. Berke sought a joint
                    attack with Baybars and forged an alliance with the Mamluks against Hulagu. The Golden Horde
                    dispatched the young prince Nogai to invade the Ilkhanate but Hulagu forced him back in 1262. The
                    Ilkhanid army then crossed the Terek River, capturing an empty Jochid encampment, only to be routed
                    in a surprise attack by Nogai's forces. Many of them were drowned as the ice broke on the frozen
                    Terek River. The outbreak of conflict was made more annoying to Berke by the rebellion of Suzdal at
                    the same time, killing Mongol darughachis and tax-collectors. Berke planned a severe punitive
                    expedition. But after Alexander Nevsky begged Berke not to punish the Rus' and the Vladimir-Suzdal
                    cities agreed to pay a large indemnity, Berke relented. Alexander died on his trip back in Gorodets
                    on the Volga. He was well loved by the people and called the "sun of Russia".[40][41]

                    When the former Seljuk Sultan Kaykaus II was arrested in the Byzantine Empire, his younger brother
                    Kayqubad II appealed to Berke. An Egyptian envoy was also detained there. With the assistance of the
                    Kingdom of Bulgaria (Berke's vassal), Nogai invaded the Empire in 1264. By the next year, the
                    Mongol-Bulgarian army was within reach of Constantinople. Nogai forced Michael VIII Palaiologos to
                    release Kaykaus and pay tribute to the Horde. Berke gave Kaykaus Crimea as an appanage and had him
                    marry a Mongol woman. Hulagu died in February 1265 and Berke followed the next year while on
                    campaign in Tiflis, causing his troops to retreat.[42]

                    Ariq Böke had earlier placed Chagatai's grandson Alghu as Chagatayid Khan, ruling Central Asia. He
                    took control of Samarkand and Bukhara. When the Muslim elites and the Jochid retainers in Bukhara
                    declared their loyalty to Berke, Alghu smashed the Golden Horde appanages in Khorazm. Alghu insisted
                    Hulagu attack the Golden Horde; he accused Berke of purging his family in 1252. In Bukhara, he and
                    Hulagu slaughtered all the retainers of the Golden Horde and reduced their families into slavery,
                    sparing only the Great Khan Kublai's men.[43] After Berke gave his allegiance to Kublai, Alghu
                    declared war on Berke, seizing Otrar and Khorazm. While the left bank of Khorazm would eventually be
                    retaken, Berke had lost control over Transoxiana. In 1264 Berke marched past Tiflis to fight against
                    Hulagu's successor Abaqa, but he died en route.

                            Öz Beg's eldest son Tini Beg reigned briefly from 1341 to 1342 before his younger brother,
                            Jani Beg (1342–1357), came to power.[94]

                            In 1344, Jani Beg tried to seize Caffa from the Genoese but failed. In 1347, he signed a
                            commercial treaty with Venice. The slave trade flourished due to strengthening ties with the
                            Mamluk Sultanate. Growth of wealth and increasing demand for products typically produce
                            population growth, and so it was with Sarai. Housing in the region increased, which
                            transformed the capital into the center of a large Muslim Sultanate.[94]

                            The Black Death of the 1340s was a major factor contributing to the economic downfall of the
                            Golden Horde. It struck the Crimea in 1345 and killed over 85,000 people.[95]

                            Jani Beg abandoned his father's Balkan ambitions and backed Moscow against Lithuania and
                            Poland. Jani Beg sponsored joint Mongol-Rus' military expeditions against Lithuania and
                            Poland. In 1344 his army marched against Poland with auxiliaries from Galicia–Volhynia, as
                            Volhynia was part of Lithuania. In 1349, however, Galicia–Volhynia was occupied by a
                            Polish-Hungarian force, and the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia was finally conquered and
                            incorporated into Poland. This act put an end to the relationship of vassalage between the
                            Galicia–Volhynia Rus' and the Golden Horde.[96] In 1352, a Mongol-Russian army ravaged
                            Polish territory and Lublin. The Polish King, Casimir III the Great, submitted to the Horde
                            in 1357 and paid tribute in order to avoid more conflicts. The seven Mongol princes were
                            sent by Jani Beg to assist Poland.[97]

                            Jani Beg asserted Jochid dominance over the Chagatai Khanate and conquered Tabriz, ending
                            Chobanid rule there in 1356. After accepting the surrender of the Jalayirids, Jani Beg
                            boasted that three uluses of the Mongol Empire were under his control. However on his way
                            back from Tabriz, Jani Beg was murdered on the order of his own son, Berdi Beg. Following
                            the assassination of Jani Beg, the Golden Horde quickly lost Azerbaijan to the Jalayir king
                            Shaikh Uvais in 1357.[98]

                    <h1> Great troubles (1359–1381) </h1>
                    <p id="4">Berdi Beg was killed in a coup by his brother Qulpa in 1359. Qulpa's two sons were
                        Christians and bore the Russian names Michael and Ivan, which outraged the Muslim populace of
                        the Golden Horde. In 1360, Qulpa's brother Nawruz Beg revolted against the khan and killed him
                        and his sons. In 1361, a descendant of Shiban (5th son of Jochi), was invited by some grandees
                        to seize the throne. Khidr rebelled against Nawruz, whose own lieutenant betrayed him and handed
                        him over to be executed. Khidr was slain by his own son, Timur Khwaja, in the same year. Timur
                        Khwaja reigned for only five weeks before descendants of Öz Beg Khan seized power.[99]

                        In 1362, the Golden Horde was divided between Keldi Beg in Sarai, Bulat Temir in Volga Bulgaria,
                        and Abdullah in Crimea. Meanwhile, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania attacked the western tributaries
                        of the Golden Horde and conquered Kiev and Podolia after the Battle of Blue Waters in 1363.[40]
                        A powerful Mongol general by the name of Mamai backed Abdullah but failed to take Sarai, which
                        saw the reign of two more khans, Murad and Aziz. Abdullah died in 1370 and Muhammad Bolaq was
                        enthroned as puppet khan by Mamai.[99] Mamai also had to deal with a rebellion in Nizhny
                        Novgorod. Muscovite troops impinged on the Bulgar territory of Arab-Shah, the son of Bulat
                        Temir, who caught them off guard and defeated them on the banks of the Pyana River. However
                        Arab-Shah was unable to take advantage of the situation because of the advance of another Mongol
                        general from the east.[100] Encouraged by the news of Muscovite defeat, Mamai sent an army
                        against Dmitri Donskoy, who defeated the Mongol forces at the Battle of the Vozha River in 1378.
                        Mamai hired Genoese, Circassian, and Alan mercenaries for another attack on Moscow in 1380. In
                        the ensuing battle, Mongol forces once again lost at the Battle of Kulikovo.[100]

                        By 1360, Urus Khan had set up court in Sighnaq. He was named Urus, which means Russian in
                        Turkish language, presumably because "Urus-Khan's mother was a Russian princess... he was
                        prepared to press his claims on Russia on that ground."[101] In 1372, Urus marched west and
                        occupied Sarai. His nephew and lieutenant Tokhtamysh deserted him and went to Timur for
                        assistance. Tokhtamysh attacked Urus, killing his son Kutlug-Buka, but lost the battle and fled
                        to Samarkand. Soon after, another general Edigu deserted Urus and went over to Timur. Timur
                        personally attacked Urus in 1376 but the campaign ended indecisively. Urus died the next year
                        and was succeeded by his son, Timur-Melik, who immediately lost Sighnaq to Tokhtamysh. In 1378,
                        Tokhtamysh conquered Sarai.[102]

                        By the 1380s, the Shaybanids and Qashan attempted to break free of the Khan's power.

                            defeated him in 1381, thus briefly reestablishing the Golden Horde as a dominant regional
                            power. Mamai fled to the Genoese who killed him soon after. Tokhtamysh sent an envoy to the
                            Rus' states to resume their tributary status, but the envoy only made it as far as Nizhny
                            Novgorod before he was stopped. Tokhtamysh immediately seized all the boats on the Volga to
                            ferry his army across and commenced the Siege of Moscow (1382), which fell after three days
                            under a false truce. The next year most of the Rus' princes once again made obeisance to the
                            khan and received patents from him.[103] Tokhtamysh also crushed the Lithuanian army at
                            Poltava in the next year.[104] Władysław II Jagiełło, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of
                            Poland, accepted his supremacy and agreed to pay tribute in return for a grant of Rus'
                            territory.[105]

                            Elated by his success, Tokhtamysh invaded Azerbaijan in 1386 and seized Tabriz. He ordered
                            money with his name on it coined in Khwarezm and sent envoys to Egypt to seek an alliance.
                            In 1387, Timur sent an army into Azerbaijan and fought indecisively with the forces of the
                            Golden Horde. Tokhtamysh invaded Transoxania and reached as far as Bukhara, but failed to
                            take the city, and had to turn back. Timur retaliated by invading Khwarezm and destroyed
                            Urgench. Tokhtamysh attacked Timur on the Syr Darya in 1389 with a massive army including
                            Russians, Bulgars, Circassians, and Alans. The battle ended indecisively. In 1391, Timur
                            gathered an army 200,000 strong and defeated Tokhtamysh at the Battle of the Kondurcha
                            River. Timur's allies Temür Qutlugh and Edigu took the eastern half of the Golden Horde.
                            Tokhtamysh returned in 1394, ravaging the region of Shirvan. In 1395, Timur annihilated
                            Tokhtamysh's army again at the Battle of the Terek River, destroyed his capital, looted the
                            Crimean trade centers, and deported the most skillful craftsmen to his own capital in
                            Samarkand. Timur's forces reached as far north as Ryazan before turning back.[106]

                            <h1> Edigu (1395–1419)</h1>
                            <p id="5">Temür Qutlugh was chosen Khan in Sarai while Edigu became co-ruler, and Koirijak
                                was appointed sovereign of the White Horde by Timur.[107] Tokhtamysh fled to the Grand
                                Duchy of Lithuania and asked Vytautas for assistance in retaking the Golden Horde in
                                exchange for suzerainty over the Rus' lands. In 1399, Vytautas and Tokhtamysh attacked
                                Temür Qutlugh and Edigu at the Battle of the Vorskla River but were defeated. The Golden
                                Horde victory secured Kiev, Podolia, and some land in the lower Bug River basin.
                                Tokhtamysh died in obscurity in Tyumen around 1405. His son Jalal al-Din fled to
                                Lithuania and participated in the Battle of Grunwald against the Teutonic Order.[108]

                                Temür Qutlugh died in 1400 and his cousin Shadi Beg was elected khan with Edigu's
                                approval. After defeating Vytautas, Edigu concentrated on strengthening the Golden
                                Horde. He forbade selling Golden Horde subjects as slaves abroad. Later on the slave
                                trade was resumed, but only Circassians were allowed to be sold. As a result most of the
                                Mamluk recruits in the 15th century were of Circassian origin. Timur died in 1405 and
                                Edigu took advantage to seize Khwarezm a year later. From 1400 to 1408, Edigu gradually
                                regained the eastern Rus' tributaries, with the exception of Moscow, which he failed to
                                take in a siege but ravaged the surrounding area. Smolensk was also lost to Lithuania.
                                Shadi Beg rebelled against Edigu but was defeated and fled to Astrakhan. Shadi Beg was
                                replaced by Pulad, who died in 1410 and was succeeded by Temur Khan, the son of Temür
                                Qutlugh. Temur Khan turned against Edigu and forced him to flee to Khwarezm in 1411.
                                Temur himself was ousted the next year by Jalal al-Din, who returned from Lithuania and
                                briefly took the throne. In 1414, Shah Rukh of the Timurids conquered Khwarezm. Edigu
                                fled to the Crimea where he launched raids on Kiev and tried to forge an alliance with
                                Lithuania to win back the horde. Edigu died in 1419 in a skirmish with one of
                                Tokhtamysh's sons.[109]

                                    was officially Khan of the Golden Horde but his authority was limited to the lower
                                    banks of the Volga where Tokhtamysh's other son Kepek also reigned. The Golden
                                    Horde's influence was replaced in Eastern Europe by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania,
                                    who Ulugh Muhammad turned to for support. The political situation in the Golden
                                    Horde did not stabilize. In 1422, the grandson of Urus Khan, Barak Khan, attacked
                                    the reigning khans in the west. Within two years, Ulugh, Kepek, and another claimant
                                    Dawlat Berdi, were defeated. Ulugh Muhammad fled to Lithuania, Kepek tried to raid
                                    Odoyev and Ryazan but failed to establish himself in those regions, and Dawlat took
                                    advantage of the situation to seize Crimea. Barak defeated an invasion by Ulugh Beg
                                    in 1427 but was assassinated the next year. His successor, Abu'l-Khayr Khan, founded

                                    Hacı I Giray fled to Lithuania to ask Vytautas for support. In 1426, Ulugh Muhammad
                                    contributed troops to Vytautas' war against Pskov. Despite the Golden Horde's
                                    greatly reduced status, both Yury of Zvenigorod and Vasily Kosoy still visited Ulugh
                                    Muhammad's court in 1432 to request a grand ducal patent. A year later, Ulugh
                                    Muhammad lost the throne to Sayid Ahmad I, a son of Tokhtamysh. Ulugh Muhammad fled
                                    to the town of Belev on the upper Oka River, where he came into conflict with the
                                    Grand Duchy of Muscovy. Vasily II of Moscow attempted to drive him out but was
                                    defeated at the Battle of Belyov. Ulugh Muhammad became master of Belev. Ulugh
                                    Muhammad continued to exert influence on Muscovy, occupying Gorodets in 1444. Vasily
                                    II even wanted him to issue him a patent for the throne, but Ulugh Muhammad attacked
                                    him instead at Murom in 1445. On 7 July, Vasily II was defeated and taken prisoner
                                    by Ulugh Muhammad at the Battle of Suzdal. Despite his victory, Ulugh Muhammad's
                                    situation was pressed. The Golden Horde was no more, he had barely 10,000 soldiers,
                                    and thus could not press the advantage against Moscow. A few months later he
                                    released Vasily II for a ransom of 25,000 rubles. Unfortunately, Ulugh Muhammad was
                                    murdered by his son, Mäxmüd of Kazan, who fled to the middle Volga region and
                                    founded the Khanate of Kazan in 1445.[113] In 1447, Mäxmüd sent an army against
                                    Muscovy but was repelled. [114]]</p>

                                    suffered a major defeat against the forces of Vasily II. Sayid Ahmad continued to
                                    raid Muscovy and in 1449 made a direct attack on Moscow. However he was defeated by
                                    Muscovy's ally Qasim Khan. In 1450, Küchük Muhammad attacked Ryazan but was turned
                                    back by a combined Russo-Tatar army. In 1451, Sayid Ahmad tried to take Moscow again
                                    and failed.[118]

                                    Küchük Muhammad was succeeded by his son Mahmud bin Küchük in 1459, from which point
                                    on the Golden Horde came to be known as the Great Horde. Mahmud was succeeded by his
                                    brother Ahmed Khan bin Küchük in 1465. In 1469, Ahmed attacked and killed the Uzbek
                                    Abu'l-Khayr Khan. In the summer of 1470, Ahmed organized an attack against Moldavia,
                                    the Kingdom of Poland, and Lithuania. By August 20, the Moldavian forces under
                                    Stephen the Great defeated the Tatars at the battle of Lipnic. In 1474 and 1476,
                                    Ahmed insisted that Ivan III of Russia recognize the khan as his overlord. In 1480,
                                    Ahmed organized a military campaign against Moscow, resulting in a face off between
                                    two opposing armies known as the Great Stand on the Ugra River. Ahmed judged the
                                    conditions unfavorable and retreated. This incident formally ended the "Tatar Yoke"
                                    over Rus' lands. On 6 January 1481, Ahmed was killed by Ibak Khan, the prince of the
                                    Khanate of Sibir, and Nogays at the mouth of the Donets River.[119]

                                    Ahmed's sons were unable to maintain the Great Horde. They attacked the Kingdom of
                                    Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (which possessed much of the Ukraine at the
                                    time) in 1487–1491 and reached as far as Lublin in eastern Poland before being
                                    decisively beaten at Zaslavl.[120]

                                    The Crimean Khanate, which had become a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire in 1475,
                                    subjugated what remained of the Great Horde, sacking Sarai in 1502. After seeking
                                    refuge in Lithuania, Sheikh Ahmed, last Khan of the Horde, died in prison in Kaunas

                                    Astrakhan in 1556, and the Khanate of Sibir in 1582. The Crimean Tatars wreaked
                                    havoc in southern Russia, Ukraine and even Poland in the course of the 16th and
                                    early 17th centuries (see Crimean–Nogai raids into East Slavic lands), but they were
                                    not able to defeat Russia or take Moscow. Under Ottoman protection, the Khanate of
                                    Crimea continued its precarious existence until Catherine the Great annexed it on
                                    April 8, 1783. It was by far the longest-lived of the successor states to the Golden
